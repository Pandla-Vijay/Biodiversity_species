This project aims to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, focusing on species observed in different park locations. The analysis involves cleaning and visualizing the data to answer several key questions: the distribution of conservation status for species, the likelihood of certain species being endangered, the significance of differences between species and their conservation status, the most frequently spotted species at each park, and the parks with the highest and lowest number of mammals. The data includes species information and recorded sightings at national parks. The project's goal is to ensure the survival of at-risk species by understanding their characteristics and relationships to the parks, using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights.
